        <p> The course has allowed me to dabble in the different ways I can employ my creativity with Digital Media. i particularly liked the environment and icon design the most. My least favourite was the video edit as it presented the most restricitons to my creativity. </p>

                A 2 Minute Premiere Pro video edit using the visuals of 'Virtual Reality-Computer Chronicles' and the audio of 'Alone at Home-Alfred Higgins Production'.
                <br><br>
                Making this taught me how to convey emotion without the use of special effects, instead through the focus of the relationship of the sound and visuals, frames and pacing only through cut editing.
                I want the audience to view a unique flowing emotional narrative that is sad, hopeful and celebratory.
                <br><br> 
                My priority was to add sound effects to the VR frames, as they had more potential to be enticing, and you can layer audio compared to the speaking/interview frames. 
                I manipulated the overlapping of music to tie unrelated visuals together, as it can indicate the same scene and situation.
                <br><br>
                Virtual Reality lacked a lot of variety in camera angles and features too many cast members all in an interview situation. This didn't give much room to make a dynamic conversation without reusing clips. In the end I tried to use frames where a cast member was in the interview alone, so that I could remix them to make interviews with different people. 
                I also liked to use the VR scenes a lot as they allowed me to add electronic sounds, music and not have to incorporate or focus strongly on the sync of speech and visuals.
                <br><br>
                Maintaining flow was extremely important in keeping a consistent emotional experience. I didn't like my attempt to construct a new sentence as it sounded robotic. I had to shuffle through a variety of sound effects to achieve appropriate music and sounds to set the mood, as the sound effects have as much impact as music. 
                For example in the 8-ball VR scene, some sounds I found of the pool balls hitting were too harsh and piercing compared to the mundane yet cheerful music. It was also very important to layer some electronic buzzing sounds or background music to connect the visual material, as it supported the old and unrefined technology, recording and experienced.
                <br><br>
                I wanted to challenge myself by avoiding darker and horror themes so I tried to make a more family friendly scene. To me, family friendly implies mundane and just boring overall, where people get fascinated by the smallest things. The VR frames inspired me to incorporate fantasy or futurism into the story which is why I started with "gaming competition". This has no storyline so I explored my options with "fantasy" and "surreal" and thought to make it progressive where the competition was the end result from being enabled by technology. The glove tech inspired me to make a physically disabled character the one that progresses with technology to where they are at.
                <br><br>
                Its very slow paced and ambitious towards the future of technology. The technology would be reflected as very futuristic and advanced but for the modern viewer, its quite old. I created this by having many sound layers, where more is better (back then) to show the chaotic unrefined, and overly ambitious energy. Futuristic aesthetic often implies sharper elemetns and sounds but to stay true to the concept, I had to find duller sounds that weren't as sharp or clear.

                    What - A Suite of 9 flat design icons that are cohesive and stick to the theme of Home.
                    Why -To learn to criticise the artistic choices (analyse art elements and principles) and appropriately select elements and develop and iterate on designs that are 'icon' appropriate whilst maintaining unity among designs and towards the theme. 
                    How -Using Adobe Illustrator and Visual Studio Code with particular focus on flat design (manipulating general shapes to make vector images) and its aesthetic arrangement on a webpage. Learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics to implement and organise a visually pleasing, accessible and interactive webpage with sound.
                    Audience -They Display the varying and turbulent family and home environment. This asks audience to be more understanding of different home situations, and possibly appreciate the positives of family and home even after tough times. In the end, it grows you as an individual.
                    Adjectives -Turbulent, Cozy, Relaxing, Memorable, Adorable, Reminiscing, Trauma

                    My suite of icons displays a range of "home" events where each event is in  a different part of the house.
                    "Home has appealed to me the most as I like to promote physical and mental comfort. It also has a lot more meaning as growing up in a materialistic and low income household, made me find more intangible associations to comfort. Home is a neutral noun, allowing the production of positive and negative household types, exploring the diverse experiences growing up in a home." (hw 4.1)
                    I did not iterate through many approaches but I did explore potential perspectives, moods, settings and emphasised objects through thumbnails. I would then gather the set of 9 that I liked the most and refined them so that the artistic elements listed above were more connected. After viewing classmates work and examples in the lectures, I wanted to frame each icon to add more consistency. I liked the idea of peaking through a window of a various shapes and went with that. Refining line size and thickness was extremely important for these windows of different design. I chose the designs and iterations in my final because they were the most unified yet displayed the variety of positive and negative emotions in a household.
                    I used Illustrator to translate the thumbnail sketches. Innitially I tried to recreate them whilst referencing the traditional sketch. The second plan was to trace a transferred image onto illustrator with the brush tool. This was extremely difficult as it created many ambiguous shapes and gaps to be coloured later (which unsurprisingly wouldn't work). The final method was to line the basic shapes for each piece and colour and layer them from there e.g. the oven back, oven flame, oven tray and oven door, being all seperate, unconnected items. I lost some details in this translation as through the creating of more parallel and clear lines, it became obvious too much detail appeared crowded, reducing emphasis and the lack of framing or rhythm.
                    I went through many half-thought of colour palettes but eventually really adored the vibrancy of the "party/celebration" icon. I reflected this in the other 8 icons utilising 2-3 hues. This was too much and reduced it to 2 hues at most with one being the more dominant. Each icon was its own identifiable colour. The variety of colour reflects the variety of household events and turbulance. i tried to also utlise whites so the window frames were balanced with the icon design behind it. The frames were white as the are extremely bright, creating that contrast where we focus on the the more colourful and darker icon designs.
                    Flat design has a very artificial appearance (due to lack of 3D aspects such as depth and realism). It possesses a sharper and clearer appearance, which I tried to reflect when choosing my sounds. For example in the Bath-Growth Icon, I used bubbles and giggles that were a bit more obvious and sharp sounding. However, it did have to be somewhat realistic sounding to really emphasise on the "window viewing" experience. It had to feel natural, so I chose less sturdy and purposeful sounds.
                    I brainstormed terms that I associated to "home", relating to myself or other people, or things I've seen on media. I selected the terms that, together, explored the most home situations, and individually, were very specific to a home environment and even a person (particularly myself). I brainstormed these terms even further to consider themes and objects that define that term the best so that the situation was explained clearly through the icon elements. I would use my sister and brother to give me their initial thoughts of what the designs displayed, and adjusted the detailing accordingly so there would be better focus to the situation. This was a short process and so was the feedback on the sound choices where we discussed the suitability to the design and whether it drew focus to the initial term e.g. the smash focuses on the crack.

                What - a 3D virtual environment of a pirate ship with Bunny characters that navigates the player to explore the maps details, create aesthetic views for the player to see and make an interactive story with a solution of killing a kraken for entertainment (dipping my toes into game design)
                Why - To look beyond the static definition and thoughts associated to art elements and principles that are viewed within a still frame and set view, and apply them to a moving, interactive environment. This makes me consider (rather than unity to tell the story) how to create a sense of navigation and plot through art elements and principles, in particular contrast. Also to create an immersive change in the environment, one that is smooth and appropriately applied. I need to consider the environments overall aesthetic/unity as the perspective is uncontrolled.
                How - Using Unity to create the virtual environment, downloading premade models on Sketchfab and coding interactive aspects and details of the game with Visual Studio Code (C#)
                Audience - Enjoy the cute feel of the game, inspired by animal crossing (a childhood game) and fill them with nostalgia and peace, then fear or a sense of bravery and ambition to tackle a kraken.
                Adjectives - Nostalgic, sweet and adorable, brave, adventurous, refreshing

                A working prototype was important to displaying my limitations in making the environment, and it taught me to how to manipulate objects. It also was very important in viewing the space and layout of objects so I could determine the mood, transition between settings and helped me decide on the cute aesthetic.
                It was very difficult as a 3D environment, especially one that is first-person makes you consider more sensory aspects and the alignment of them (e.g. responsiveness, distance etc.). You had to properly consider placement and depth of items seen as the player navigates the setting. It had to flow and be accessible and wasn't just simply as looking into the window frame of the previous assignment. The objects and details had to feel like they belong in the environment and weren't just an ambigious entity. My character had to be on a similar level to the NPC rabbits. Not only that, thinks had to move and sound organic, so being on water and having NPC's meant I had to animate them to move somewhat naturally. 3D environments involve more involvement from different platforms especially visual studio code.
                The camera in the 3D environment was first person. it was moving frames and viewing different areas. It was very immersed within the environment with having environmental sounds following or nearby. The setting was controlled but the first person virtual camera wasn't where the player could view things at their desired angle. This is very different to assignment 1 as the viewing angles were fixed and even chosen to maintain consistency. The interview type settings meant that viewers were looking onto cast members rather than interacting with them, making them feel outside of the loop, a spectator rather than explorer.
                I used music attached to the main camera (player camera) to create a constant background music that follows the player around. I attached ocean and environment sounds (wind, seagulls etc.) to the water terrain, so that when entering the bottom of the ship, it became a little bit more blocked off and muted. Other objects I tried to emit distance, so the babbling, helm and kraken sounds, i attached to the actual objects so when the player walks further away, it exaggerates the size of the boat. I didn't have to consider distance too much in assignment 1. Occasionally I would layer quiet sounds and music to associate scenes and in assignment 2, i mostly edited a conversation between sounds e.g. in the pets one i had to make the barking and meowing seem conversational.
                I made sure every object I used was low poly or relatively low detailed with more solid colours and minimal shading (mostly by brightness rather than hue). In terms of scaling, I stuck to consistent large vs tiny and short scales (small for characters and tiny for details which made it look cute and large for sense of exploration). I did not finish this environment so it did not evolve. I also utlised the fog to help overlay a lot of the colours in the environment as I used a range of colourful values.
                Everything must be specific otherwise exploration isn't smooth or functions are interrupted. I didn't get very far in it's development as I was in a difficult circumstance and couldn't spend time on the assignment to code difficult areas. Play testing helps gives a sense of where the character is, what they see (so I can fix the elements to increase the overall mood), what they have access to and with this, how obvious the exploration points are. This is difficult to see from just looking over the whole map.
